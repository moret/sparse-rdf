You know, this is still WIP.

First, make sure you have installed and running MongoDB and ElasticSearch on localhost and on their default ports.

The project requires Python 2.7. To run it, I'd recommend using virtualenv. All other requirements are installable from PyPI using pip. Something like:

mkdir sparse-rdf_env
cd sparse-rdf_env
virtualenv --no-site-packages --python=python2.7 .
git clone https://github.com/moret/sparse-rdf.git
cd sparse-rdf
pip install -r requirements.pip

And to run the tests:

paver tests

Go on and develop.
