You know, this is still WIP.

The project required Python 2.6. To run it, I'd recommend using virtualenv. All other requirements are installable from PyPI using pip. Something like:

mkdir sparse-rdf_env
cd sparse-rdf_env
virtualenv --no-site-packages --python=python2.7 .
git clone https://github.com/moret/sparse-rdf.git
cd sparse-rdf
pip install -r requirements.pip

And to run the tests:

paver tests

Go on and develop.
